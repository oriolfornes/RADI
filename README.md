# raDI
`raDI` (**r**educed **a**lphabet **D**irect **I**nformation) is a variation of the direct-coupling analysis (DCA) algorithm that groups physico-chemically equivalent amino acids prior to the computation of DCA. `raDI` achieves similar results than the original DCA while reducing the computation time by more than 30-fold for sequences with length of ~1,000 residues. Moreover, `raDI` overcomes the quality of predictions based on mutual information (MI); the accuracies and distributions of contacts predicted by `raDI` are higher and more useful than those predicted using MI, while reducing the time of computation more than 180-fold.
